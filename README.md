## ImmyBotClone

`ImmyBotClone.ps1` provides a simple example of how you can build a lightweight automation framework similar to ImmyBot. It maintains a device inventory (`Devices.json`) and allows you to execute scripts from the repository on remote machines using PowerShell remoting.

### Prerequisites
- PowerShell 7 or later
- Remote systems should have PowerShell remoting enabled (`Enable-PSRemoting -Force`)

On Debian-based systems you can install PowerShell with:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install -y powershell
```

Run the script with PowerShell:

```powershell
./ImmyBotClone.ps1
```

You can then add devices, list them and execute scripts from the `Scripts` folder on those devices.
